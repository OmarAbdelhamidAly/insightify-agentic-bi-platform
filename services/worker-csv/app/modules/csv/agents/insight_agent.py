Based on the analysis results, write:

1. **insight_report**: A detailed analysis in plain English (3-5 paragraphs).
   - Always quantify findings: "23% drop" not just "dropped".
   - Reference specific data points.
   - Explain the "why" behind the numbers when possible.

2. **executive_summary**: Max 3 sentences. Plain English. No jargon.
   - Lead with the headline finding.
   - Include the key number.
   - State the implication.
